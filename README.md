# kilo_text_editor
A single-file text editor written in C in around 1000 lines and of a size on the order of magnitude of a kibibyte.  Inspired by Salvatore Sanfilippo's (antirez) kilo text editor in C: https://github.com/antirez/kilo. This goes a bit beyond his implementation with search capabilities.
